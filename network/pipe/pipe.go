// Package pipe implements a nonblocking Reader/Writer pair; data can be

// we implement the ipx.ReadWriteCloser interface. Second, calls to
// WritePacket() never block. Third, there is an internal buffer of packets
// that have been written but not yet read from the pipe. The size of the
// buffer is configurable. Once the buffer is full, WritePacket() will
// return errors until the reader drains the pipe.
